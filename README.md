Example of using 386 Debug Registers. 
## Where does this program work
This program Works under pure MS-DOS only, meaning that the CPU has to be a real-mode, not in a protected mode or a virtual 8086 mode, such as one provided by DESQview / QEMM.
## What this program does
This program unpacks any MS-DOS executable file which was initially a .COM file but was then packed (with or without code obfuscation or compression) to an .EXE file.
## Usage
Rename any file you wish to unpack to RABBIT.EXE, copy it in the same directory with COMUNP.COM and run COMUNP.COM
